## Man-in-the-middle Vulnerability in Cohesity Support Channel [CVE-2021-28124]
 

### Problem Description

A man-in-the-middle vulnerability in Cohesity DataPlatform support channel  in version 6.3 up to 6.3.1g, 6.4 up to 6.4.1c and 6.5.1 through 6.5.1b. Missing server authentication in impacted versions can allow an attacker to Man-in-the-middle (MITM) support channel UI session to Cohesity DataPlatform cluster. 



### Impact

This vulnerability could expose the Cohesity cluster UI password when used by the Cohesity support engineer over the support channel. Support channel only uses public-key authentication to access SSH on customer systems, the same attack is not possible against SSH because of the way the session key is agreed upon.
 
CVSS 3.1 BASE score 6.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)



### Resolution

To remediate the vulnerability, Cohesity recommends applying the patch 6.3.1g-Hotfix1  if running 6.3.1g or 6.4.1c-Hotfix10 if running 6.4.1c or upgrading the cluster to 6.5.1c or later.
Customers currently on release 6.5.1c or above are not vulnerable to this issue and can disregard this notice.
